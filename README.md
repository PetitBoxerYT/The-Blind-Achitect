# The Blind Architect

**The Blind Architect** is a procedural roguelike built as an experiment in AI‑driven game creation.  
Every part of the project — concept, mechanics, systems, and code — is produced exclusively through text, without visual tools, editors, or manually crafted assets.

The goal is to explore how far an AI can go when acting as a *blind architect*: designing a world it cannot see, using only logic, structure, and code.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

You play as `@`, navigating a procedurally generated ASCII dungeon.  
Enemies `E` pursue you in real time.  
Your objective is to find the **key** `K`, reach the **door** `D`, and escape to the next level.

Each level is generated entirely by code, ensuring a unique layout every run.

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

- **Text‑only creation pipeline** — no sprites, no editors, no visual design tools.  
- **AI‑driven development** — all mechanics and systems are generated through iterative text instructions.  
- **Emergent complexity** — the game evolves version by version, adding layers of logic and structure.  
- **Reproducibility** — everything is defined in code, making the project transparent and easy to extend.
